Miscellaneous gEDA symbols and footprints library
---

There are scripts to generate PCB footprints in the top-level directory.
Most of the files in footprints/ are generated by these scripts, but they are checked in so this directory can be used immediately upon cloning.

fpgen.py is a Python module that helps create footprints.
